                        <h4>Do Something That Don't Scale</h4>
                        <p>"One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to do things that don't scale. A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don't. You build something, make it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case the market must not exist."</p>

                        <h4>How to Make Wealth</h4>
                        <p>"If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. That's been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word "startup" dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the Middle Ages."</p>

                        <h4>Great Hackers</h4>
                        <p>"A few months ago I finished a new book, and in reviews I keep noticing words like "provocative" and "controversial."" To say nothing of "idiotic.""</p>
                        <p>"didn't mean to make the book controversial. I was trying to make it efficient. I didn't want to waste people's time telling them things they already knew. It's more efficient just to give them the diffs. But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book."</p>

                        <h4>The Age of the Essay</h4>
                        <p>"Remember the essays you had to write in high school? Topic sentence, introductory paragraph, supporting paragraphs, conclusion. The conclusion being, say, that Ahab in Moby Dick was a Christ-like figure."</p>
                        <p>"Oy. So I'm going to try to give the other side of the story: what an essay really is, and how you write one. Or at least, how I write one."</p>

                        <h4>How to Start a Startup</h4>
                        <p>"You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed."</p>
